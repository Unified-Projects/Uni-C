# Uni-C
Uni-C is a language that follows c++ like syntax with a mix of other syntax from other languages. With development ongoing their is no intentions to turn this language into a usable and complete form due to the level of complexity behind complete toolchains.

# Status
With no AST there is still the requirement of using another assembler and linker for actual exectuable production.
